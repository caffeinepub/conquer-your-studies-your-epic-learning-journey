  "summary": "The diff implements a tabbed app shell with two main pages, a battle/war-map themed UI with status color mapping, a War Map dashboard rendering syllabus items as cards, and a Divide & Conquer page with React Query hooks wired to a Motoko canister. However, key requirements around task CRUD/completion semantics, required static generated image assets, and the exact motivational quote text are not fully met based on the provided diff summary.",

      "requirement": "Dashboard renders syllabus items in a map-like layout (nodes/tiles connected or arranged as territories).",

      "requirement": "Divide and Conquer supports create, view, update, and mark tasks as completed (moving them into Victory Zone) with completion reflected per task.",
      "reason": "Backend and UI treat status as a single status on the syllabus item, not per-task. There is no per-task completion state; updating a task \"status\" updates the parent item status and isCompleted flag, and tasks are stored only as [Text].",

      "reason": "Backend exposes getAllSyllabusItems/getSyllabusItem, createSyllabusItem, addTaskToSyllabusItem, and updateTaskStatus, but tasks are plain text entries with no task IDs/status; there are no explicit methods to list tasks by chapter/topic, update task text, or complete individual tasks.",
